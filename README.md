# Missing Error Handling in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers.  The example shows a route that fetches user data. If the user is not found, or if a database error occurs, the application may crash or return an unhelpful response.

The solution demonstrates how to properly implement error handling to gracefully manage various scenarios, enhancing the application's robustness and user experience.
